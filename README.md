*Project Description:*

This is a simplistic, one-player version of the classic family game: UNO.
The player will be able to play with 3 bots. The player and the bots will
take turns placing cards that are either of the same color or the same type
(i.e. reverse, skip). If there are no valid cards to play, the player will
draw 1 card. Otherwise, the name of the game is to put down all cards.

Of course, say UNO when you're down to 1 card and UNOOUT when you're down to 2.
